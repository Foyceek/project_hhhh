## Software description
Put flowchats/state diagrams of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source/testbench files in src and sim folders.

## Component(s) simulation
Write descriptive text and put simulation screenshots of your components.

## Instructions
1. Use switches 1 and 2 to select one of four melodies. The melody number shows on the display.
2. Use switches 12 and 13 to choose the playback speed.
3. A green LED shows when a melody is playing. A blue LED blinks when the melody restarts.
4. To stop playback, use switch 15. This changes the green LED to red.
